description: Retrieve and validate an Azure DevOps Work Item for bug-fix eligibility, producing a structured bug-details.md artifact. Use when a workflow needs to fetch and validate a Bug work item before any analysis or fix work begins. Do NOT use for root-cause analysis, source code inspection, code modification, running tests, or creating branches/commits.

# ADO Bug Retrieval

## PURPOSE

Retrieve and validate the Azure DevOps Work Item identified by
the current task and produce a structured, size-capped
bug-details.md artifact.

This skill performs Work Item retrieval and eligibility
validation only.

It must not perform root-cause analysis, inspect source code,
modify code, run tests, create branches, commit changes, or
implement fixes.

---

## PROHIBITED SOURCES

The following are never permitted as input, fallback, or
verification source at any point during this skill's execution:

- Git history
- Repository files or source code
- Existing working-repo/.agent/bug-details.md
- Existing working-repo/.agent/bug-analysis.md
- Memory or cached Work Item information
- Previous workflow output or agent output
- Assumptions based on similar bugs or prior executions

This prohibition applies to all sections of this skill without
exception.

---

## INPUT

The task provides the current Azure DevOps Work Item ID.

The Work Item ID provided in the current task is the only
authoritative identifier for this execution.

Do not obtain or infer the Work Item ID from any other source.

---

## AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE

The Azure DevOps Work Item retrieved through the Azure DevOps
MCP tool is the only authoritative source for this skill.

Use only the current Work Item retrieved for the current task.

---

## RETRIEVAL RULES

1. Retrieve the Work Item using the Azure DevOps MCP tool.
2. Use the exact Work Item ID provided in the current task.
3. Verify that the retrieved Work Item ID exactly matches the
   requested ID.
4. Do not continue processing if the retrieved ID does not
   match the requested ID.
5. If the retrieved ID does not match, set:
   BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE
   INELIGIBILITY_REASON=WORK_ITEM_MISMATCH
6. If the Work Item cannot be retrieved or no valid Work Item
   is returned, set:
   BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=RETRIEVAL_FAILED
7. Never retry retrieval using a different Work Item ID.
8. See PROHIBITED SOURCES for all forbidden fallback sources.

---

## ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

A Work Item is ELIGIBLE only when all four criteria below pass.

### Criterion 1 — Work Item Type

The Work Item type must be exactly: Bug

If the type is anything else:
BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE
Reason: WORK_ITEM_TYPE_NOT_BUG

### Criterion 2 — Work Item State

The Work Item state must be exactly one of:
- Active
- In Progress

If the state is anything else:
BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE
Reason: WORK_ITEM_STATE_NOT_ACTIVE_OR_IN_PROGRESS

### Criterion 3 — Reproduction Information

At least one of these fields must contain non-empty content:
- Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps
- System.Description

Empty means the field is null, missing, whitespace-only, or
contains no meaningful text after stripping HTML markup.

If both fields are empty:
BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE
Reason: REPRO_STEPS_AND_DESCRIPTION_EMPTY

### Criterion 4 — Duplicate Status

Check the System.Reason field of the retrieved Work Item.

If System.Reason equals Duplicate:
BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE
Reason: WORK_ITEM_MARKED_DUPLICATE

Do not infer duplicate status from title text, comments,
links, relationship metadata, or any source other than the
System.Reason field.

---

## ELIGIBILITY DECISION

Set BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=ELIGIBLE only when all four
eligibility criteria pass.

Set BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=NOT_ELIGIBLE when one or more
eligibility criteria fail.

If multiple criteria fail, record all applicable reasons on
the same line separated by semicolons.

Example:
WORK_ITEM_TYPE_NOT_BUG;WORK_ITEM_STATE_NOT_ACTIVE_OR_IN_PROGRESS

For an eligible Work Item, INELIGIBILITY_REASON must be blank.

For a retrieval failure, set BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS=RETRIEVAL_FAILED
and record a concise retrieval failure reason in
INELIGIBILITY_REASON.

---

## FIELD EXTRACTION RULES

Populate bug-details.md using only data retrieved from the
current Azure DevOps Work Item.

Do not infer missing values from repository code or external
context. See PROHIBITED SOURCES.

Strip HTML markup from retrieved fields before extracting
field values. Apply the specified word limit after stripping.

### WORK_ITEM_ID
Use the retrieved Work Item ID. Must exactly match the
requested Work Item ID.

### WORK_ITEM_TYPE
Use the retrieved Work Item type. Expected value: Bug

### BUG_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS
Use exactly one of: ELIGIBLE, NOT_ELIGIBLE, RETRIEVAL_FAILED

### INELIGIBILITY_REASON
Blank when eligible. One line stating the failed criterion
or criteria when not eligible. Concise retrieval failure
reason when retrieval fails.

### TITLE
Use the Work Item title. Maximum 20 words. Preserve meaning
without adding information when shortening is necessary.

### STATE
Use the retrieved Work Item state exactly as returned.

### ASSIGNED_TO
Use the retrieved assigned person's display name.
If no assignee: Not Available
Do not infer from comments, commits, or repository data.

### AFFECTED_AREA
Use an affected area explicitly identified in the Work Item.
Prefer in order:
1. Explicit component, service, or controller named in the
   Work Item.
2. Azure DevOps Area Path when it clearly represents the
   affected area.
If not determinable from the Work Item: Not Specified
Do not inspect repository code to determine this value.

### REPRO_STEPS_SUMMARY
Summarize the retrieved Repro Steps and/or Description.
Maximum 80 words. Preserve the essential reproduction
sequence, inputs, and relevant conditions.
Do not add technical steps not present in the Work Item.

### EXPECTED_BEHAVIOUR
Summarize the expected behavior stated in the Work Item.
Maximum 40 words.
If not specified: Not Specified
Do not infer from application code or general assumptions.

### ACTUAL_BEHAVIOUR
Summarize the actual or observed behavior stated in the
Work Item. Maximum 40 words.
If not specified: Not Specified
Do not infer from source code or previous analysis.

### ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA
Summarize the Work Item's Acceptance Criteria.
Maximum 40 words.
If absent or empty: Not Specified
Do not create or infer acceptance criteria.
